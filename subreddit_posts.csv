1,1," Hey all,

I want to retrieve all speeches from congressional records from the house of representatives where the politician talks about the tax behavior of companies. I currently load the records into my script and divide the records into all the speeches. Then I use keyword search to determine whether the politician talks about tax behavior of companies. I want to replace this keyword search with an LLM which classifies the speeches. I will analyze > 50,000 speeches, so I dont want to use a costly model like GPT4. Actually I want to spend max 10€ in total. What LLM's, which I can access via an API, would you recommend for this task?

I was underwhelmed by the coding performance (running the 70B model on https://llama2.ai/).  It has consistently failed most of the very-easy prompts that I made up this morning.  I checked each prompt with ChatGPT 3.5, and 3.5 got 100% (which means these prompts are quite easy).  This result was surprising to me based on the discussion and articles I've read.  However, digging into the paper (https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-2-open-foundation-and-fine-tuned-chat-models/), the authors are transparent that the coding performance is lacking.

Are my observations consistent with the results others are getting?

I haven't had time to keep up with all the open-source LLMs being worked on by the community; are there any other models that approach even ChatGPT 3.5's coding performance? (Much less GPT 4's performance, which is the real goal.)"

### Apple Kind of Announces “Apple GPT” but Very Little is Known

“Apple GPT”, the first generative AI product from Apple. Is suspected to be in [***development***](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.441MImsSoxRGHgUkwX0gBAFXhSC4TpHCLciQkXj8SVU).

What we know so far is that Apple is developing its AI with secrecy. Only a few teams are currently working on the project. On top of this is their new LLM, “Ajax”, developed only for their AI.

There is a lot we do not know.

When will “Apple GPT” be released? To whom is the AI for? What is its purpose? How is Apple handling distribution? And will the technology be integrated into existing products?

Here is what you can expect:

*When will “Apple* *GPT” be released?*

Some speculate as early as next year, while others believe the announcement will come sooner. But knowing Apple it may be a while. Thanks to their history of trying to achieve perfection.

*To whom is “Apple* *GPT” for?*

Most likely Apple users. Creating an exclusive AI, only for the Apple ecosystem. But it is possible the AI will be available for the public and even free to use.

*How is* *Apple* *handling distribution?*

For Apple distribution will not be a problem. As they can count on Apple users. But, distribution across the globe is a different story.Not everyone has or wants Apple products, so getting their AI to them would be difficult.

*Will the technology be integrated into existing products?*

Yes and no, I would like to know how Apple would do this.It is possible through Siri, their voice assistant, or some other interface.But if Apple does integrate AI into the ecosystem, it would be a game changer for all of us.

Imagine being able to talk to your phone and have it complete tasks in the background. That is the type of innovation we are talking about.

This is not the first nor the last Apple AI product, or as they like to call it, machine learning.

#### How would Apple stack up in the AI market?

It is a busy marketplace for AI.New AI chatbots are being released almost monthly at this point.With larger and more innovative LLMs being built every day.

Take a quick step back and look at the AI marketplace:

* Google Bard
* Microsoft Bing Chat
* Meta LLaMA 2
* ChatGPT-4
* Hugging Face Models
* AWS Falcon

As you can see the market is quite crowded.

Everyone has their piece of the pie. Their own niche, and followers. Followers that use a specific AI daily and will continue to do so. At least until something better comes along.

*Where would or could* *Apple* *fit in?*

The only place I see Apple making a name for itself is with its consumers.

Apple cannot hit the business AI marketplace, or even the generative AI one as well.

They are too late.By the time their chatbot is released, users will already have developed a go-to AI.

So what is left? Their consumers. The users that are “stuck” in the Apple ecosystem.

Apple has a cool trick of getting their users to buy a new product or get a new accessory. Without it, the ecosystem becomes harder to navigate.

It is possible that Apple could do something like this with AI. Integrate AI into their ecosystem so that users are stuck with it. Making their lives easier and harder, so that they must live with it. Solving distribution and eventually data issues.

Although I love Apple getting into AI, it may be a long shot. Apple does not have the capabilities to bring massive change to AI and thus the world.

Yes, it is still quite early. But that is the funny thing with AI. It is moving extremely fast. Innovation is far outpacing many expectations. And will continue to do so.

Can Apple *keep up* with the new AI trends? Then release an effective product, that users want.

That is a tall order, for any company. **Knowing** **Apple, they may find a way**.

slmqa is a simple question-answer evaluation benchmark for small language models. It includes a dataset of 909 general knowledge question-answer pairs. The QA pairs were generated with gpt-3.5-turbo, stripped of duplicates and answers shorter than 5 characters, and cleaned by hand.

The score is the percentage of correct answers.

8,8,"With the emergence of new models gaining more popularity such as Claude 2, Llama 2 which has the potential for better fine-tuned models, the development of Bard, the controversies surrounding ChatGPT performing worse and with the already-existing content filters that limits the capabilities of models not just subjecting to moral standards and policies that align with human values but also limits it to other factors that may not fall under objective morality or maybe just it being too sensitive, is there a certain model you think is currently the best overall one at least for now other than GPT-4?

12,12,"Hello ! 

I'm working on a project of NLP classification with more or less 13k classes. The best model I had so far is a fine-tuned LLM encoder. However, with the number of classes I have now, it is very slow. So I searched for ways to deal with that, and found 2:

1. Hierarchical Softmax
2. Negative Sampling

However, both seems to have been used nearly only in the context of word2vec training, so I wonder if there is a reason why that would not work for a ""classical"" classification ? (or just my kind of problem too rare ?) 

Also, I did find really few implementations of those with Pytorch, a fortiori with transformers... Is it because there is something better ? Do you know, if not, some recent implementations ?

13,13,"This is specifically in regards to automatic mask generation, where SAM samples a grid of points (32x32 grid by default) and creates a mask for each point prompt.

But, the ""Everything"" option in the web demo([https://segment-anything.com/demo](https://segment-anything.com/demo)) does insanely well. It can even segment occluded objects into a single disconnected mask. It is supposed to be running in the browser and is reasonably fast, so they can't be doing some super heavy pre/post-processing either.

18,18,"According to the paper Neural Networks are Decision Trees (Aytekin 2022), every single type of neural network - regardless of the activation functions used - can be reduced to an equivalent decision tree with equivalent accuracy: [\[2210.05189\] Neural Networks are Decision Trees (arxiv.org)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.05189)

That is not to say that decision trees necessarily tend to converge on the same types of solutions as neural networks in training; only that a trained neural network can be represented by an equivalent decision tree.

The algorithm, as mentioned in the paper, is:

*Algorithm 2: Algorithm of converting neural networks to decision trees*

*1 Initialize Tree: Set root.*

*2 Branch all leafs to k nodes, decision rule is first effective filter.*

*3 Branch all nodes to k more nodes, and repeat until all effective filters in a layer is covered.*

*4 Calculate effective matrix for each leaf via Eq. 5. Repeat 2,3.*

*5 Repeat 4 until all layers are covered.*

*6 return Tree*

1. Is anyone aware of the inference performance implications of this? In my general understanding, decision trees tend to be much more computationally efficient at both training and inference. So is it true that this represents an opportunity to decrease the processing load of inference on neural networks, or does the computational complexity of performing inference with an equivalent decision tree tend to approach or surpass the equivalent neural network?
2. Question 2 is kind of a moot point if #1 doesn't provide performance benefits. But assuming it does, does anyone know of techniques in 2023 for reducing a neural network to an equivalent decision tree? "

21,21,"Hey [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/),

The team at TruEra recently released an open source project for evaluation & tracking of LLM applications called [TruLens-Eval](https://github.com/truera/trulens/tree/main/trulens_eval). We’ve specifically targeted retrieval-augmented QA as a core use case and so far we’ve seen it used for comparing different models and parameters, prompts, vector-db configurations and query planning strategies. I’d love to get your feedback on it.

The core idea behind the project is feedback functions. Analogous to labeling functions, feedback functions are models used to score the text produced by LLMs. We already have a variety of out-of-the-box feedback functions to use for eval including relevance, language match, sentiment and moderation that can be applied to inputs, outputs or intermediate steps of your application.

On top of eval, there’s also built-in tracking of cost and latency.

We made it easy to integrate with different setups using connectors for langchain, llama-index + an option to use it without a framework.

It's pretty well known that LLMs have firmly established themselves as leaders in the field of natural language processing, consistently pushing the limits of language comprehension and generation, which is widely acknowledged.

I spent a little time playing around with few-shot prompting for OpenAI's Davinci model and I discovered that noisy data still has drastic effects even on powerful LLMs like Davinci.

The resulting few-shot prompt with accurately labeled examples produced **20% fewer errors** than the original one with mislabeled examples.

26,26,"So  very recently, a new paper was published to ArXiV called ""Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models"": [https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621).  The title makes a fairly strong claim regarding the success of the  model: transformers have long been established as among the best  general-purpose learning techniques in the deep learning literature.  Self-describing as a ""successor to transformer"" is therefore not to be  taken lightly.

From what I can  tell, the math checks out, and the authors demonstrate an intriguing  dualism between their transformer-like ""retention"" (analogous to  attention) and an equivalent recurrent formulation. The core idea is  that you can train in parallel (as with transformers) and then run  inference in sequence with O(N) time and memory requirements in the  length of the sequence (traditional transformers are O(N\^2)).

If  the results can be replicated/peer-reviewed, this could pave the way  for substantial all-round improvements to large language modelling. The  authors have indicated that they will make code available relatively  soon.

For now though, there's an  unofficial implementation on GitHub which hopefully will allow those  interested to play around with the model and verify some results. The code is publicly available and can be found by searching  Jamie-Stirling/RetNet on GitHub."

I tried to find some documentation on it but I was unable to understand the exact process.

Basically most documentation show them concatenating all the graphs together into a larger graph and then passing it through a GCN module but I don't think that would work since graphs are clearly distinct and independent of each other. Even if I concatenate them together, pass them through through the module and then separate them later using the same bounds by which I concatenated would it cause any unpredictable behaviour (even though the graphs technically do not have edge connecting them)? Do I have to code this logic myself or is it hidden somewhere in PyG since I was unable to find it. I am new to GCNs so I just want to see if I have it right before I commit to it."

Keeping the configs as is from the repo except iterations raised to 3,90,000 and batch size = 2 (reason being my colleague produced good results using the same config on a similar dataset), I fine-tuned the pretrained model on our dataset. I have the following training curves:

For sanity check, I have been saving weights at regular intervals and have made inferences on them over some handful sample images for mask quality. However, what I have observed is that out of **10368 curated polygons,** even after such long training, my model has predicted only **7401  polygons.**

**Discussion Points:**

1. What should I do to increase the predicted polygon numbers without compromising the quality of masks?
2. Which hyper-parameters (or parameters) I should look into while fine-tuning (or training) for better mask quality and higher f-score?

I've been searching for quite a lot of time, and I absolutely can't find anything. Even the original ViT paper had no information in this regard.

34,34,"I've got model pretraining running on NanoGPT for a GPT2 tokenized dataset and a TokenMonster tokenized dataset, so I can compare the difference. It's only a 100M parameter model, so it doesn't do much.

What benchmark can I use? NanoGPT runs on Pytorch, so I could use something that integrates with PyTorch, or I could use something that sends text prompts and analyzes text responses (or token IDs.)

Is there a standard benchmark that uses the full, non-instruct trained format? For example:

    Answer the following questions:
    Question: What is the capital of France?
    Answer: Paris.
    Question: What is the opposite of up?
    Answer:

The model is only 100M parameters and not instruct trained, so it usually just rambles instead of answering. But anything that gives me a quantifiable result that can compare 2 models for quality is useful. I have loss and perplexity already, but it's not enough."
35,35," Hi all,  
I  am currently trying to improve synthetically generated images (not by  AI) in a particular domain. I have a dataset with real images of the  domain and one with synthetic data. If I now train a classifier to say  whether an image is real or synthetic, after a short ""time"" the  classifier has a very high accuracy with a very high confidence. Then I  have two cases.

**First case**:  
In the next step I change my synthetic images (e.g. by a bayer pattern) and the confidence of the classifier decreases.

**Second case**:  
Alternatively, if I simply take synthetic images from another domain, the confidence also drops.

**How can I prove or check that I am still in the right domain in the first case?**

If we imagine that there's a prediction model that can forecast some number of forward steps and we can compare this prediction with the observation, we can get the errors at each time point. Then perhaps one possible way of detecting whether a sequence is anomalous is to get the mean error within the sequence and compare it with the distribution of the mean of the mean of errors of sequences which is calculated from validation data. For example, this distribution may be Gaussian. However, this method sounds a bit naïve since for it to work it would have to assume independence between the errors and some other properties.

Hello everyone,

I've embarked on a project involving Unity's ML-Agents toolkit, and I've hit a roadblock regarding GPU utilization. My system is equipped with an AMD GPU, and I'm aware that most machine learning libraries and tools mainly support NVIDIA GPUs due to their compatibility with CUDA.

Has anyone here successfully gotten ML Agents to work optimally with an AMD GPU? If not, are there any alternative methods or libraries you recommend that work well with AMD GPUs?

So far, my attempts with TensorFlow and PyTorch have been met with limited success due to their restricted support for AMD GPUs. I've been exploring other potential options like PlaidML and OpenCL, but I'd love to get some input from this community.

Any suggestions or resources on tackling this issue would be hugely appreciated. Thank you!"

If this post content is something you are expert in and would like to work with me to accomplish these goals as part of my team I am able to compensate you. I am currently building my team.

I have pictures of a 3d printed part that I have sequentially lit by different small light sources, each positioned at a known 3d location relative to the part. The lights are less than 2 meters from the part.  Each light casts specific shadows on the part. I measure the size of the shadows and relate them to the angular direction to the origin of the light (2D bearing). My next prototype has photodiodes that I will use to measure the % of shading on each diode by photoexcitation as a voltage. I want to build a pattern recognition model to relate the two outputs to the incident angle of light. This is so in the future I can output the bearing direction towards a light source with an unknown 3d relative position via voltage, and be able to validate the voltage data from images.
 
Please guide me towards a Machine Learnig platform or engine (for lack of me knowing a better term) that could take this data (% surface shading & voltage) as input and learn how to extract the 2d bearing (and more) from sensor to light source.

>In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost O(1) inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code will be available at [this https URL](https://aka.ms/retnet).

[ Figure 1: Retentive network \(RetNet\) achieves low-cost inference \(i.e., GPU memory, throughput, and latency\), training parallelism, and favorable scaling curves compared with Transformer.

**GTP 3.5 16k summary (slightly edited):**

>The research paper titled ""Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models"" proposes a new architecture called Retentive Network (RetNet) as a successor to the Transformer model for large language models. The paper addresses the limitations of Transformer models in terms of inefficient inference, high memory consumption, and limited scalability.  
>  
>The authors introduce the concept of retention, which combines the benefits of recurrence and parallelism. The retention mechanism supports three computation paradigms: parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent.  The parallel representation enables training parallelism, the recurrent representation allows for low-cost O(1) inference, and the chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity. The RetNet architecture consists of multi-scale retention modules and feed-forward network modules.  
>  
>The retention mechanism is formulated as a dual form of recurrence and parallelism. It employs content-aware projections to compute contextualized vector representations and utilizes a parallel or recurrent formulation for training and inference. The chunkwise recurrent representation further enhances training efficiency by dividing input sequences into chunks, enabling parallel encoding within each chunk and recurrent encoding across chunks.  
>  
>The authors describe the overall architecture of RetNet, which consists of multiple blocks, each containing a multi-scale retention (MSR) module and a feed-forward network (FFN) module. The MSR module performs the retention operation, while the FFN module handles the feed-forward computation. The architecture is designed to optimize training parallelism, inference efficiency, and memory consumption.  
>  
>The paper compares RetNet with various existing models, including Transformers, Linear Transformers, recurrent neural networks, and other Transformer variants. Experimental results show that RetNet achieves comparable performance to Transformers in language modeling tasks while providing more efficient training and inference. RetNet exhibits favorable scaling properties, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. It outperforms other models in terms of memory consumption, throughput, and latency during inference.  
>  
>The authors also conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components and design choices in RetNet. They demonstrate that the swish gate, GroupNorm, multi-scale decay rates, and larger head dimensions contribute to improved performance.  
>  
>Overall, the paper presents RetNet as a strong successor to Transformer models for large language models. Its retention mechanism combines the benefits of recurrence and parallelism, enabling efficient training and inference while maintaining competitive performance. The proposed architecture addresses the limitations of Transformers and offers advantages in terms of memory consumption, speed, and scalability.

### 🚀 Features

🔥 **Reproduce SAM**. SAM training is a sub-task of ours. We have released the training code to reproduce SAM training.

🔥 **Beyond SAM**. Our newly proposed model offers the following attributes from instance to part level:

* **Granularity Abundance**. Our model can produce all possible segmentation granularities for a user click with high quality, which enables more **controllable** and **user-friendly** interactive segmentation.
* **Semantic Awareness**. We jointly train SA-1B with semantically labeled datasets to learn the semantics at both object-level and part-level.
* **High Quality**. We base on the DETR-based model to implement both generic and interactive segmentation, and validate that SA-1B helps generic and part segmentation. The mask quality of multi-granularity is high.

65,65,"By now, most of us who tried have realized that the ""autonomous LLM agents"" are not really useful at the moment. We need to create applications that are helpful, predictable and reliable that will produce acceptable results, in place of endless toil to get these agents to do something. We really just need good, specific LLM products that can do at least one thing properly, like - doing some research, writing a report, summarizing content - things an LLM might actually be good at.

So we thought it would be a good idea to create a framework that makes use of [LoopGPT](https://github.com/farizrahman4u/loopgpt) agent's memory and custom tooling capabilities. Let's jump right into the new features of this framework.

First, using LLMs within Python functions, where you only write the function's docstring and the LLM will return the result as a valid python literal whenever you call the function.

This is achieved by using the `loopgpt.aifunc()` decorator:

    @loopgpt.aifunc()
    def shakespearify(text: str) -> str:
        """"""Applies a shakespearian style to the given text and returns it.
    
        Args:
            text (str): Text to apply shakespearian style to.
        
        Returns:
            str: Text with shakespearian style.
    
        """"""
    >>> shakespearify(""Hey man, how you doin? I was just heading to the store ya know"")
    'Hark, good sir! How art thou faring? I was but making my way to the market, dost thou know.'

You can add tools for the function to collect data from (e.g., GoogleSearch,  Browser, etc.):

    @loopgpt.aifunc(tools=[GoogleSearch])
    def find_age(celeb: str) -> int:
        """"""Searches Google for the celebrity's age and returns it.
        
        Args:
            celeb (str): Name of the celebrity.
        
        Returns:
            int: Age of the celebrity.
    
        """"""
    >>> find_age(""Robert De Niro"") + find_age(""Al Pacino"")
    162

Agents can now ""watch"" tools being run and any AI functions being called in their context can access their memory:

    @loopgpt.aifunc()
    def outline_maker(topic: str) -> str:
        """"""Writes an outline of the given topic.
    
        Args:
            topic (str): Topic to write an outline about.
        
        Returns:
            str: Outline of the topic.
    
        """"""
    
    search = GoogleSearch()
    browser = Browser()
    agent = loopgpt.empty_agent()
    
    with agent:    # the agent will ""watch"" the searching and the browsing
        results, links = search(""SVB Banking Crisis"")
        for i in range(2):
            browser(links[i])
        
        outline = outline_maker(""SVB Banking Crisis"")    # this AI function can access the memory of 'agent'
    
    print(outline)
    
    1. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB) and its impact on the crypto market.
    2. The closure of SVB leading to a bank run at Signature Bank.
    3. Regulators intervening to prevent a larger financial meltdown.
    4. The FDIC attempting to make all depositors whole, regardless of insurance.
    5. Government investigation into SVB's failure and stock sales by financial officers.
    6. Moody's downgrading the outlook on the U.S. banking system.
    7. Other banks being placed under review for a downgrade.
    8. Proposed legislation by Sen. Elizabeth Warren and Rep. Katie Porter to strengthen bank regulations.
    9. Banking crisis reaching Europe with Credit Suisse losing share value.

66,66,"Hello, fellow machine learning aficionados!

As everyone is aware, machine learning is transforming a wide range of sectors, including healthcare, banking, entertainment, and transportation. But have you ever stopped to think about the more subtle effects it's causing in our day-to-day activities?

hi all,

I developed a small inference library in C++ that can run Stable Diffusion in 260MB of RAM.

The minimum recommended RAM/VRAM for SD is 8GB.

This is achieved by offloading the weights on disk, by quantization and attention slicing (which is similar in principle to FlashAttention, without the fused kernel).

It currently supports 24 ONNX operators.

The idea is to allow the inference of very large (transformer) models on very limited devices.

68,68,"I recently made a new JupyterLab extension called [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) (𝐂𝐡𝐚ts in Ju𝐏𝐲𝐭𝐞𝐫) that aims at solving many pain points when using other AI coding assistants. I want to share with y'all the tools as well as my thinkings while building this.

**What is Chapyter**

Chapyter is a JupyterLab extension that seamlessly connects GPT-4 to your coding environment. Here are the key features: 

* **Code generation from natural language and automatic execution**   
Simply adding the magic command `%%chat` at the beginning of the cell of a natural language description of the task, the code is generated and the results are shown in a few seconds.

https://i.redd.it/y7l0s9pf5hcb1.gif

* **Using coding history and execution output for code generation**  
By adding the `--history` or `-h` flag in generation, chapyter can use the previous execution history and outputs to generate the appropriate visualization for the loaded IRIS dataset.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7pu6cbug5hcb1.gif

* **In-situ debugging and code editing**  
The generated code might not be perfect and could contain bugs or errors. Since Chapyter is fully integrated into Jupyter Notebook, you can easily inspect the code and fix any errors or bugs (e.g., installing missing dependencies in this case) without leaving the IDE.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/mz4n4qsh5hcb1.gif

* **Transparency on the prompts and AI configuration and allows for customization**  
We release all the prompts used in our library and we are working on easy customization of the used prompts and settings.
* **Privacy-first when using latest powerful AI**  
Since we are using OpenAI API, all the data sent to OpenAI will not be saved for training (see [OpenAI API Data Usage Policies](https://openai.com/policies/api-data-usage-policies). As a comparison, whenever you are using Copilot or ChatGPT, your data will be somewhat cached and can be used for their training and analysis.

**Why did I build Chapyter?** 

* Sometimes, I want to have an AI agent to *take over* some coding tasks, i.e., generating and executing the code and showing me the results based on some natural language instruction.
* I want the AI agent to be fully integrated in my IDE such that it can provide context-aware support and I can easily inspect and edit the generated code. 
* I want transparency on how the code is generated (knowing the prompts) and want to customize the code generation sometimes
* I want to keep my code and data private as much and I am hesitant to upload any WIP progress code/data elsewhere.

Surprisingly or unsurprisingly, NONE of any existing AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT Code Interpreter can satisfy all of the above requirements. We include more details here in our [blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter). 

Please check our Github Repo [Chapyter](https://github.com/chapyter/chapyter) and our [latest blogpost](https://www.szj.io/posts/chapyter) for more details. Feel free to try it out and looking forward to your thoughts :)"
69,69,"Hello,

I've been curious as to how far we can take small(7B and less) models for production use cases with small amounts of training data for each task.

So far I've been able to fine-tune LoRAs for paraphrasing, changing the tone of a sentence, dialogue summarization and topic generation. The results look promising, especially the fact that all this can run on very modest hardware.

Finetuning was done in 4bit mode using bitsandbytes. Each task had \~1k training points.

I've used a AMD Ryzen9 3900XT + 3080(10gb) + 32gb ram for all the training and inference here. On my system I get 12-15 tokens/sec during inference.

All the details can be found here: [https://github.com/kuutsav/llm-toys](https://github.com/kuutsav/llm-toys).

* Data used for training
* Training params and the training/eval losses are present in the huggingface model cards
* Evaluation(wherever possible atm)

Models: [https://huggingface.co/llm-toys](https://huggingface.co/llm-toys)

Why do all this?

Mostly to answer the question - can we move away from OpenAI and other players for very particular use cases, how much data it takes, where does it break, etc. So far I've not been able to find pre-trained model(7b and small) that did well on these tasks. Even larger models(around 40b) failed to give consistent results. The fine-tuned model on huggingface were also not good enough in my trials. For paraphrasing I could not find even a single fully tuned model that was able to correct basic typos.

Do give it a shot, there is a colab notebook available as well try it directly. Will really appreciate some feedback on these model's performace."

The paper is almost done except for one section that's currently (almost) empty.

I recently started learning about CUDA programming, and I realized that many people share the same crucial problem: lack of an NVIDIA GPU. I looked around online and found several methods (gpu-ocelot, certain versions of CUDA, etc.), but I recently found a way that can allow us to practice CUDA by using the GPU offered by Google Colab! As a free user, the amount of GPU access you get may probably be enough to PRACTICE working with CUDA. If you really need more credits, the Colab Pro is only $10 / month, and it's still much cheaper than getting a new GPU or an entire new PC if you have a Macbook like I do. Again, the justification of ""enough computing credits"" is based on the assumption that you aren't running any heavy-lifting programs but more reasonable, **practice-based** codes.

I have outlined a step-by-step guideline in this repo that I created - just check out the `CUDA_on_Colab.ipynb` file: [https://github.com/notY0rick/cuda\_practice](https://github.com/notY0rick/cuda_practice)

If you know of any good alternatives, let me know (:

Update: To those asking for resources, I just started, but I intend to follow along this book - Professional CUDA C Programming by John Cheng, published by O'Reilly.

Update 2: some people asked how they can edit C++ code on Colab, and if you follow the steps on the notebook I linked in my GitHub repo above, you should reach this configuration in your Colab, and this will allow you to write/edit your code and run them however you want!

**Abstract**

A major risk of using language models in practical applications is their tendency to hallucinate incorrect statements. Hallucinations are often attributed to knowledge gaps in LMs, but we hypothesize that in some cases, when justifying previously generated hallucinations, LMs output false claims that they can separately recognize as incorrect. We construct three question-answering datasets where ChatGPT and GPT-4 often state an incorrect answer and offer an explanation with at least one incorrect claim. Crucially, we find that ChatGPT and GPT-4 can identify 67% and 87% of their own mistakes, respectively. We refer to this phenomenon as hallucination snowballing: an LM over-commits to early mistakes, leading to more mistakes that it otherwise would not make.

94,94,"Deodel is a new predictive algorithm with a peculiar set of characteristics:

- performs classification intermixed with regression
- supports both types of attributes/features: nominal or continuous
- admits mixed types, categorical and numerical, in the same attribute column
- supports multi-class target prediction
- admits missing values in the training and query/test data
- good accuracy

https://github.com/c4pub/deodel

It started as a type of discrete nearest neighbor classifier and it has been extended to support continuous attribute values. The continuous values are discretized, and although this step entails a loss of information, the classification accuracy is surprisingly good in many settings. Occasionally, deodel outperforms more established algorithms like RandomForest, GradientBoostingClassifier, LogisticRegression, MLPClassifier, etc. See here:

https://github.com/c4pub/misc/blob/main/notebooks/deodel_vs_sklearn_on_titanic.ipynb

The latest version is also capable of doing regression. It automatically switches between classification and regression modes. It can interweave the two modes in the same predictive session."
95,95,"I entirely get that federated learning can add considerable overhead to collaborative ML projects. However, the idea of being able to leverage the data of other companies/institutions for mutual gains seems like a very powerful concept. Even still, I am yet to really see federated learning ventures between companies beyond R&D projects. Is the tech to immature? People just don't care about sending data to central servers? 

How long, if ever, before FL has the chance to take off?"

97,97,"**So I had a question: can neural networks trained on ImageNet be used in zoological research? E.g., for distinguishing between similar looking animals?**

For example, what would be the accuracy of these neural network in distinguishing the following types of images:

1. Leopard vs Cheetah
2. Hare vs Rabbit
3. Crocs vs Alligators
4. Llamas vs Alpacas
5. Common hippo vs Pygmy hippo
6. Kangaroo vs Wallaby

I looked into the ImageNet dataset on Kaggle and it appears that a lot of these very hard-to-distinguish classes are grouped together (i.e., leopard and cheetah are treated as a single class). So NN trained on ImageNet cannot be used if one wishes to use them to distinguish these animals. Some of the animals (such as Alpaca and Aardvark, I believe) are not even contained in the dataset.

Can anyone confirm my observation? Are there any other way to get around this problem with the current ML techniques without having to curate a large dataset used exclusively for this type of animal classification?"
